## Subprojects related to AGH course "Deep Learning In Medical Image Analysis".
The notebooks are modified for executing the provided tasks, but they are not trivial.  

The course was gradually expanding on ideas related to deep learning up to making deep neural networks e.g. for image classification or generation.

*Lab 7 - Very hard and the most time consuming laboratories, cannot find a source of an error.*  
*lab 8 - Autoencoder is correctly implemented, however Variational Autoencoder is not correct, but cannot determine a reason for it.*

> *Note: there is lab 9 (GANs), however it is mandatory to finish the lab 8 properly.*
